# Lab Instructions

## Lab Requirements

These are the requirements to complete the self-assessment lab. Use these requirements to guide the construction of your application. If you get stuck, refer back to the lab or course material to help you along. We have written the requirements as a user story.

Task: Implement person directive to display a list of Authors

## User Story:

As a user, I want the ability to display a list of Authors and view the detail when I click on the Details button so that I can learn about various authors.

## Acceptance Criteria:

The directive displays the Name, Nationality, and Dates of each Author in the first three columns
Add a Details button in the fourth column which will display an alert to the user with the author Name
When the mouse is over the row, set the background to silver
When the mouse leaves the row, set the background back to white

## TIPS:

Download the starting point for the lab
Remember to restrict the directive to Elements only
Set the replace property in the directive to true so the HTML will be replaced
Use isolated scope named  data
Include a method named action that will be used for the ng-click call on the Details button
Initially, your app should look like the following screenshot:
