# Lab Requirements

These are the requirements to complete the self-assessment lab. Use these requirements to guide the construction of your application. If you get stuck, refer back to the lab or course material to help you along. We have written the requirements as a user story.

> Task: Implement a date picker allowing dates today or later

## User Story:

As a user, I want the ability to select a date with a date picker that is either today's date or in the future and display the selected date so that I can see the selected date.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- A Datepicker control is displayed on the page
- The Datepicker control is initially bound to today's date
- Don't allow dates in the past
- Hide the week numbers
- Display the selected date in a `<pre>` tag and apply the date filter

## TIPS:

- Download the starting point for the lab
- Don't forget to use the date filter for the selected date
- To hide the week number use the date-picker-options attribute of the datePicker control and set it to a dateOptions object on the model
- Additional information on the controls can be found at the Angular Bootstrap site

Your finished work should look like the following:
