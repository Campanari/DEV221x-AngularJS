# Course Overview and Schedule

By taking this Advanced Framework Techniques with Angular course, you will gain the knowledge and tools experience that are necessary to implement the full range of advanced features available for programming in Angular. This course will explore each of these features in depth, and will show you why so many programmers prefer using Angular.

> Note: Although this course has been written based upon AngularJS 1.5.5, for the sake of brevity, the nickname "Angular" will be used instead of the full name and version from here on.

## Students

This course is best suited for those wanting to build upon an existing basic understanding of Angular. See our introductory course, Framework Fundamentals with Angular , for more details about what constitutes a basic understanding of Angular.

In addition to a basic understanding of Angular, the following categories define the minimum level of programming experience (in any software development language) that is expected for this course:

Junior-level developers who work in a professional environment or anyone who has published an application to an app store
Students with programming experience or who have completed one or more 100-level programming classes
Hobbyist programmers who already have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript training or knowledge
Schedule
Advanced Framework Techniquess with Angular is a self-paced course that consists of six modules. All six of the modules are available when the course begins, and you can work your way through the modules at your own pace (the course will close after about 5 months).

While each student will complete this course at their own pace, we anticipate that an average student will be able to complete the core lab assignments in about 12-18 hours (averaging 2-3 hours per module). We recommend that you attempt to complete one module per week, and rather than pushing on to the next module, that you allocate any additional study time that you have (for a particular week) to exploring suggested resources and experimenting with what you've learned during the labs. A slower or faster pace may work well for some students, but we believe that this approach will be affective for most students.

## Module Structure

The initial section in each of the modules (the Resource Content section) includes a collection of topic area documentation and links to additional resources. We suggest that you take the time to read through the contents of the documentation section, especially if you are not familiar with the topic areas for a particular module. After reviewing the documents in the resource content section, you will work your way through a series of tutorial style labs that guide you step-by-step through the implementation of tasks associated with the topics areas for that module. The final lab for each module is a self-assessment lab. This self-assessment lab provides you with the opportunity to evaluate what you have learned during the module. Rather than showing you how to implement the solution, this lab challenges you apply the techniques that you learned during the tutorial labs. We highly recommend that you spend the time necessary to complete each of the self-assessment labs.

## Tutorial Labs

Each module contains a series of tutorial lab assignments. These labs guide you step-by-step through an implementation scenario, and provide you with an explanation of what you are accomplishing as well as why it is important. This is your opportunity to gain experience implementing a particular technology.

Some assessment questions will be presented during the tutorial labs.

## Self-Assessment Labs

After completing the tutorial labs for a given module, you are assigned a self-assessment lab. The self-assessment lab gives you a chance to evaluate how well you have retained the skills that you learned while completing the tutorial labs.

Some assessment questions will be presented during the self-assessment lab.
